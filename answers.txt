1. BigDecimal provides more precision for numbers with a specific decimal accuracy, such as
dollars and cents which always is a 2 decimal number. Double has to provide space within the
memory of the number for exponents etc, while BigDecimal can give 32 bits to an integer always
having 2 decimal points.

2. Throw early, catch late: throw exceptions as soon as the issue is found, catch them only
when they can be handled effectively.

Use exceptions only when normal processing won't work; i.e. only throw exceptions down the stack,
not in the same function.

Use descriptive custom exceptions or messages, and catch them effectively without simply ignoring
or snuffing the exception.
